DESCRIPTION
====================================
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears 
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet 
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits 
the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player 
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

PHASE 1
====================================
make a ship that can move right 
and left when the player presses the arrow keys and fire bullets when the 
player presses the spacebar

PHASE 2
=======================================
add aliens to Alien 
Invasion. add one alien near the top 
of the screen and then generate a whole fleet 
of aliens. make the fleet advance sideways 
and down, and  get rid of any aliens hit by a bullet. 
Finally, we’ll limit the number of ships a player has and 
end the game when the player runs out of ships
